This directory contains tests to compare the old way of getting occurrences
from the db (Samuel's implementation) with the new way of getting occurrences (Conny's implementation).

Besides the test modules, this directory also contains a copy of the ph2_occurrence.class.php
and a copy of the p2deafel.php. Both of these copies contain the old implementations.
